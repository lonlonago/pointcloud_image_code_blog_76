As an amateur software developer, I have come up with another interesting little thing that is completely free to use. 

 It uses the existing deep learning network for audio recognition, and then packages it into a separate module. The way to use it is to download the software, and then open the folder where the audio is located. It will automatically scan the file at the end of the wav, mp3 suffix and perform the conversion.

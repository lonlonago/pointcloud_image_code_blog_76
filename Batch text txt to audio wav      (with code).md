 As an amateur software developer, I have come up with another interesting little thing that is completely free to use. 

 It uses the deep learning network of the existing audio TTS, and then encapsulates it into a separate module. The way to use it is to download the software, and then open the folder where the txt text is located. It will automatically scan the text file at the end of the txt suffix and perform the conversion wav. 

 The disadvantage of the software is that it is relatively large, because the models are placed locally, so there is no need to go to the Internet to call the model interfaces of major Internet companies, but if your computer is running slowly, it may not be suitable for use.

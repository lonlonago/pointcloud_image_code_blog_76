 For each point, the distance to its nearest point is calculated.

From this, we can determine the average distance between all the points in the cloud.

From this average distance, it can be used to estimate the radius parameters of some other algorithms, the distance parameters,

For example, the field distance parameter of normal vector calculation, the distance threshold parameter of the distance.

In addition, different sampling devices and different distance from the scene will cause differences in point cloud density.

Most of the existing methods for estimating point cloud density are based on distance.

The average distance density representation based on distance is calculated by calculating the average distance of each point in the point cloud

To estimate the density of point cloud distribution.
